            Function creates a new linear-phase resampler object
            </summary>
            
            <param name="srcSampleRate">Source signal sample rate. Both sample rates can be 
            specified as a ratio, e.g. SrcSampleRate = 1.0, DstSampleRate = 2.0.</param>
            
            <param name="dstSampleRate">Destination signal sample rate</param>
            
            <param name="maxInputBufferLength">The maximal planned length of the input buffer (in samples) 
            that will be passed to the resampler. The resampler relies on this value as
            it allocates intermediate buffers. Input buffers longer than this value
            should never be supplied to the resampler. Note that the resampler may use
            the input buffer itself for intermediate sample data storage.</param>
            
            <param name="reqTransBand">Required transition band, in percent of the
            spectral space of the input signal (or the output signal if
            downsampling is performed) between filter's -3 dB point and the Nyquist
            frequency. The range is from CDSPFIRFilter::getLPMinTransBand() to
            CDSPFIRFilter::getLPMaxTransBand(), inclusive. When upsampling 88200 or
            96000 audio to a higher sample rates the ReqTransBand can be
            considerably increased, up to 30. The selection of ReqTransBand depends
            on the level of desire to preserve the high-frequency content. While
            values 0.5 to 2 are extremely "greedy" settings, not necessary in most
            cases, values 2 to 3 can be used in most cases. Values 3 to 4 are
            relaxed settings, but they still offer a flat frequency response up to
            21kHz with 44.1k source or destination sample rate.</param>

            Function clears (resets) the state of the resampler object and returns it 
            to the state after construction. All input data accumulated in the
            internal buffer of this resampler object so far will be discarded.

            <summary>
            Function performs sample rate conversion.
            If the source and destination sample rates are equal, the resampler will do
            nothing and will simply return the input buffer unchanged.
            
            You do not need to allocate an intermediate output buffer for use with this
            function. If required, the resampler will allocate a suitable intermediate
            output buffer itself.

            This pointer may point to the address within the "ip0" input buffer, or to
            *this object's internal buffer. In real-time applications it is suggested
            to pass this pointer to the next output audio block and consume any data
            left from the previous output audio block first before calling the
            process() function again. The buffer pointed to by the "op0" on return may
            be owned by the resampler, so it should not be freed by the caller.</param>
            
            <returns>The number of samples available in the output buffer. If the
            data from the output buffer is going to be written to a bigger output
            buffer, it is suggested to check the returned number of samples so that no
            overflow of the bigger output buffer happens.</returns>
